Subject: Urgent â€“ Unauthorized Transaction on Loan Account  

Dear Loan Servicing Team,  

I noticed an **unauthorized transaction of $5,000** on my loan account "**Horizon Mortgage**" on **April 5, 2024**. I did not make this transaction, and I believe my account may have been compromised.  

Please **freeze my loan account immediately** and investigate this matter. I have attached my latest statement for reference.  

Loan Account Number: **123456789**  

This is an urgent matter, and I would appreciate a swift resolution.  

Best Regards,
Joe
